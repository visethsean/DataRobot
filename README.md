# DataRobot

This project aims for the internship at DataRobot.

1.	Dataset: Online News Popularity from UCI, 2015 (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity)
2.	Number of Instances: 39644 (at the time I downloaded)
3.	Number of Attributes: 61 (including target variable)
4.	Missing Attribute Values: None
5.	Task: Regression-Building predictive models for predicting the number of shares (attribute: shares) for a particular         article published by Mashable (www.mashable.com)
6.	Google Prediction API (GPA):
    a.  Using GPA to build the model for regression analysis.
    b.  Pros: Easy to use; just upload data for model source and then build the model.
    c.  Cons: GAP offers only 2 types of analysis tool: regression and classification. Both tools require many observations          in order to make good prediction. And as expected, it took lots of time to build the model when more data was added.         They need the input data to be in an exact format: response be the first columns, while the remainings be the                predictors. There is no functionality of data partition as well as dimension reduction (even simple task like                ignoring some predictors in building the model). Also, there's no option for performing analysis with                        cross-vaildation.

7.	R Script:
    a.  Initial data processing: remove string predictor, and other irrelevant/duplicate predictors.
    b.  Sampling data: since the data is big, I randomly partitioned the data into training (5000) and test set (1000). 
    c.  Data exploration:
        -   Compute correlation between response and predictors: each predictor seems to be not really                                   correlated with the response as the highest correclation score is only: 0.135 (predictor: kw_avg_avg).
        -   Visualize relationship between repsone and its highest correlated predictor
        -   The visualization display some data points to be outliers; so, to avoid being influenced by them, I removed those             data points.
    d.  Approach (using train/test set and cross-validation):
        -   Linear Regression with the most correlated variable: I tried polynomail models and selected degree = 3 as the                best according to p-value. And the RMSE for test data is 225.41 
        -   Since there're a lot of predictors, I tried some methods to reduce the number of predictors: Forward subset,                 Backward subset. Both suggest slightly different number of predictors in term of different metrics: Adjusted R^2,             Cp, BIC.
        -   Since the subset selection suggest to use more predictors, I tried a bunch of Multiple Linear Regression models              with a bunch of different predictors accordingly.
        -   Then I tried Ridge and Lasso which are very applicable for data with many predictors. But, they did not really               get a good result comparing to previous models.
        -   Next, I tried PCR, another regression technique for data with many predictors. Again, the result was not very                helpful.
        -   Last, I tried cross-validatoin with Lasso, Ridge and PCR.
        -   The best result so far is the Linear Regression with one most correlated predictor
